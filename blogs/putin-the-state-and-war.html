                    <p>

                        Most International Relations (IR) scholars would agree that figuring out causes of war is the
                        ultimate holy grail in the field. Understanding war is key to preventing it, and there is a
                        tonne of material on war that one can read, but Kenneth Waltz’s <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man,_the_State,_and_War" target="_blank">Man the State
                            and War (1959)
                        </a> is one of the best
                        books out
                        there. The book organises what’s been written about the causes of war into a useful framework.
                    </p>
                    <span class="image fit"><img src="../images/war3.jpeg" alt="" style="width:700px;height:auto;margin-left: auto;
                        margin-right: auto;" /></span>
                    <p>
                        The following is an attempt to use the framework presented by Waltz to understand the war in
                        Ukraine, but first a quick summary of what the book says. Waltz offers three images (think of
                        them as levels of analysis) at which he says causes of war may be found:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First image: human nature (man). Humans are the main cause, but some thinkers believe
                            education can be the solution whereas others think humans are intrinsically evil and
                            incurable.</li>
                        <li>Second image: the state. Proponents of this theory believe causes of war lay in the
                            structure of the state. The assumption is basically good states don’t go to war, bad states
                            do. We can think of two categories here: the liberals who believe that democracies tend to
                            do more trade and cooperation with other countries. Closer ties (and globalisation) mean
                            states are too interlinked to go to war. The socialists, on the other hand, think it’s class
                            struggle and inequality that lead to war, and if we abolish capitalism peace will prevail.
                        </li>
                        <li>Third image: causes of war can be found at the international level. States in the
                            international system exist in a state of “anarchy”. Anarchy in International Relations
                            doesn’t mean chaos, but that states live in an environment with no overarching authority
                            over them. State survival is key, and if there’s no one to arbitrate or enforce
                            international decisions, a state has only itself to fend for its security and interests and
                            these should be taken very seriously.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Again, this blog is not about assessing the three images Waltz proposed, nor is it advocating
                        one of them as the main cause of war over the others. Theory is meant to capture one element of
                        reality; that’s how theory is useful. Reality, on the other hand, is extraordinarily complex,
                        and often, a vast web of reasons coalesce together to cause an event to happen.
                    </p>

                        Understanding the war in Ukraine through the prism of Waltz’s three images:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The first image, <i>man</i>:<br />

                            First, understanding Putin’s psychological profile is important here. Doing this properly
                            would take years, but I want to highlight that Putin is an ex KGB officer. According to this
                            paper on the CIA’s website, “Spies frequently have pathological personality features that
                            pave the way to espionage, such as thrill seeking, a sense of entitlement, or a desire for
                            power and control.” Couldn’t agree more. Add to that the fact that Putin has been ruling as
                            the undisputed leader in Russia for 22 years now (Medvedev was a constitutional necessity
                            and Putin’s puppet 2008-2012). Such a long time in power is bound to get into your head.

                            <span class="image fit"><img src="../images/kgb-putin.png" alt="" style="width:700px;height:auto;margin-left: auto;

                            Second, many people spent lockdown doing quizzes with friends and family and reviving old
                            hobbies. Not Putin. Putin most likely spent it in the Kremlin library reading about Ukraine
                            and the history of the region. In fact, Putin wrote a 2000 word essay on how Russia and
                            Ukraine are one nation published on July 12th 2021. This shows how personal the matter
                            became to Putin.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The second image, <i>the state</i>: <br />
                            There’s no doubt that because Putin keeps a tight grip on the domestic politics in Russia
                            that he’s able to take his country on such dangerous foreign adventures like the war in
                            Ukraine. There’s no meaningful opposition that can voice a different opinion due to years of
                            systematic suppression and demonisation.

                            Putin is also able to manipulate public opinion and disseminate lies that justify any course
                            of action he decides to take. The Putin regime are masters of deceit and propaganda, but
                            sadly justifying conflict is not a hard job to achieve for Putin as these things become a
                            self fulfilling prophecy after the first step of aggression is taken. Sanctions and Western
                            reaction can then be easily used to back up the Putin regime’s lies as no one really cares
                            about who started it. Would Putin have been able to achieve what he achieved domestically if
                            Russia had been a democracy? We will never know. After all, Blair and Bush managed to start
                            war from two democracies, but it’s clear that they had to overcome more obstacles
                            domestically than Putin had, obstacles that could have potentially stopped the war. Again,
                            we will never know.

                        <li>The third image, <i>the international system</i>: <br />

                            Russia for sure had legitimate security concerns over NATO expansion into the east. The main
                            argument against this view is usually that NATO is a defensive alliance and the statement
                            that “the West will never attack Russia, are you mad!”. These statements might be true, but
                            Russia can’t take this as the ultimate guarantee when the risks involve its own security and
                            therefore survival as a state.

                            I’ve found this is often the most misunderstood point when it comes to the war in Ukraine,
                            so I’m going to try and explain my view more. NATO has no intention of attacking Russia is
                            not the same as NATO cannot attack Russia. This is the nub of the argument here. The reason
                            this differentiation is made is because situations change and leaders change, and what is
                            today seen as outrageously impossible might not be the case in 10 or 20 years. Sadly Ukraine
                            itself provides an example supporting this point. When Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons
                            in 1994, they had all the assurances in the world, and it was impossible to see at the time
                            a war in Europe and an aggressive Russia that would attack. The situation has changed and
                            those promises didn’t prove useful to Ukraine in 2022.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        To get back to my main argument, Russia had legitimate concerts over NATO expansion, but the
                        full invasion of Ukraine beyond the Donbas region has no realpolitik calculations whatsoever.
                    </p>


                    <p>

                        There is no doubt all three images combined are the reason why we are where we are in Ukraine.
                        But if we want to do a little blame apportioning exercise in light of the above analysis, it’s
                        clear that Putin shares the bulk of the blame individually as a person. How?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We saw how Putin in the first image is an arrogant dictator, and probably a psychopath given his
                        KGB roots, who became obsessed with Ukraine to a level where most observers have started to
                        question his sanity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Putin is also pretty much the reason why Russia is a dictatorship (image two). As mentioned
                        above, Putin used every trick in the book in the last 22 years to make sure his opponents are
                        either in jail, exile or dead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for the third image, Putin had legitimate concerns about NATO and Ukraine potentially
                        becoming a member of NATO, but he didn’t need to launch a full invasion of Ukraine. Russian
                        backed separatists in the east had already made sure Ukraine couldn’t join NATO as NATO members
                        can’t join if they have a territorial dispute with any other neighbouring country. But if Putin
                        wanted to make sure, he could’ve stayed in the Donbas region. The fact that he decided to go all
                        the way to Kiev can’t be explained/justified by the third image. Again it’s Putin that’s to
                        blame here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So in summary, and at least applicable to the war in Ukraine, it seems that man is the most
                        potent cause of war, one man in particular, Putin.
                    </p>
