                    <p>China has increased its engagement with the Middle East (ME) in recent years. But before we can
                        discuss China’s role in the ME, it’s important to briefly outline a
                        framework underpinning the analysis presented here. Entire books are normally dedicated to this
                        task, but I’ll try and summarise a framework in a few sentences. The assumption made here
                        is that everything in the world can be understood through the prism of great power politics. The
                        international system has certain configurations that help shape events across it. Currently the
                        configuration of the international system is unipolar, meaning the US is the sole superpower in
                        it with no rival that’s equal in power. Power here is mainly military, but the size and strength
                        of a country’s economy and the stability and soundness of its political system are also vital
                        elements of projecting power.

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_(international_relations)"
                            target="_blank">Balance of power theory
                        </a>dictates that power will always be balanced, and thus the international
                        system is heading in the direction of becoming bipolar where two equally powerful countries
                        dominate the system (like the US and USSR in the cold war).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        China is the ascending country trying to claim that position against the US. China is still not
                        even close to reaching this point but the speed of its rise makes it the only potential
                        candidate for this position in the foreseeable future. Of course China claiming this position in
                        the international system will not happen overnight. It’s hard to know how close China is right
                        now to achieving that objective. This is because measurement of state power is a complex
                        endeavour. That said, it’s very likely that we will see an event such as military intervention
                        in Taiwan that will signal China’s readiness to officially assume the role of a challenger to
                        the US in the international system and usher in a new era in international politics.

                    </p>
                    <p>Now let's go back to the subject of this blog. China has increased its political, economic and
                        security engagements in the Middle East (ME) in recent years, just as the US decided to withdraw
                        from the region. This shift taking place in the Middle East is due to two main reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The US used to import millions and millions of oil barrels from Saudi Arabia on a daily
                            basis only a couple of decades ago. Today, the US is almost energy self-sufficient and is on
                            course to becoming an exporter of oil by 2030. In contrast, half of China’s crude oil
                            imports
                            today come from the ME. China is growing rapidly, and this growth can’t happen without oil.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As part of a strategy to contain the rise of China, the US seems to have decided to
                            take the competition close to China, the so-called “pivot to Asia”. However, China seems to
                            be using the gap created by the US to bolster its relations with ME countries and secure
                            that much needed fuel for its economy.

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        In return for energy, China is offering ME countries development in the form of infrastructure
                        projects and increasingly military cooperation. Sounds straightforward doesn’t it? But nothing
                        ever is in the ME. China faces significant challenges trying to keep everyone happy in a region
                        ravaged by conflict and rivalry. The longer China remains in the region and the deeper its
                        involvement becomes, the harder it becomes for it to remain everyone’s friend, and this is
                        assuming the US doesn't get sucked into the region again.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When China reaches a position where it can challenge US power and the world becomes bipolar
                        again, every region in the world will be important, including the Middle East. This was the case
                        during the cold war when the USSR supported countries like Syria and Egypt and the US tried to
                        counter balance by supporting Israel.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s very likely that this will happen before the end of this decade, and it will then be in the
                        US interest to try and stop the flow of oil from ME to China as the Second Cold War
                        erupts between China and the US. Energy is a vital element to how and whether any state can
                        project
                        power on the international scene.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given the above analysis, what does this mean for China’s role in the ME and the challenges it
                        faces?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Politics in the ME is complex but can be simplified using the concept of <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_(international_relations)"
                            target="_blank">balance of power
                        </a>
                        regionally. There are three main powers in the ME and two (main) opposing camps. The three main
                        powers are Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel. The two camps are Iran and its satellites on the one
                        hand (including Iraq, Syria, Hizbulla in Lebanon and the Hothis in Yemen), and the anti-Iran
                        camp on the
                        other (comprising Saudi Arabia, UAE and Israel). Although Saudi Arabia and Israel have a mutual
                        interest in checking Iran’s influence in the region, they are not natural allies, and they
                        disagree fundamentally on a lot of things, especially on Palestine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such regional dynamics combined with the international dynamics of the Second Cold War will have
                        significant ramifications for the region and for the two superpowers in the international
                        system.

                    </p>
                    <p>What does it mean for Saudi Arabia?
                    </p>
                    <span class="image fit"><img src="../images/china2.webp" alt="" style="width:700px;height:auto;margin-left: auto;
                        margin-right: auto;" /></span>
                    <p>
                        As discussed above, one of Saudi Arabia’s top objectives in the region is to check Iran’s power.
                        To be able to do that, Arabia needs to sell its oil to get the money needed to achieve this
                        objective. Given that the US is now almost self-sufficient when it comes to energy,
                        Arabia has no other alternative but to go to China. Already, the Sino-Arabian relations have
                        changed significantly in the last few years, with Arabia now considering taking payments for oil
                        in Yuan instead of US Dollar.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now this could be a strategy devised by Saudi policy makers to focus US attention on the region
                        again, but this could become a dangerous strategy as it won’t be easy for Arabia and China to
                        break ties after
                        years of cooperation. Whether Arabia plans a fully-fledged and deep alignment
                        with China or it's trying to attract US attention is something we will only know years in future
                        when documents about this and accounts
                        by people involved are made public.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For now the US seems to be OK with Saudi Arabia providing China with huge amounts of oil, but
                        there will come a point when the US asks Arabia to pick sides and stop the flow of oil to China.
                        The US could of course offer to buy or find a replacement buyer for Saudi oil, but this can only
                        be an option if the extent of China Saudi relations was limited to the economic realm and no
                        security agreements were in place between China and Saudi Arabia by the time the US decides to
                        intervene.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Energy is a vital element in any superpower's efforts to project force abroad. Chinese security
                        presence is likely to follow economic dependence on Saudi oil as China will not deem it wise to
                        leave shipments of oil from Arabia unprotected. When this happens, Arabia will have an important
                        choice to make about which direction to go.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arabia’s decision on who to align with will have a significant impact on its objectives in the
                        region. Arabia could benefit from aligning with the US if US policy makers had the same vision
                        Henry Kissinger had in 1973 when the US supported Israel against Syria and Egypt in the 1973 war
                        to weaken the USSR and to convince USSR proxies that the USSR is not a reliable patron. But if
                        Arabia was to align with China, it would find itself in a difficult position when it comes to
                        countering the influence of Iran in the region. Given the deep animosity between Iran and the
                        US, and the need for Iranian leadership to maintain this animosity for domestic reasons, Iran is
                        most likely to be allied with China for the long term. This means China will be working very
                        hard to
                        manage the rivaliry between two important allies of hers and the two main providers of oil in
                        the region;
                        Arabia and Iran (and its satellite Iraq). Arabia could find itself unable to take some decisions
                        that might disadvantage Iran under pressure from China if Arabia decided to side with China, and
                        in the case of a failure by China to stop a war starting in the region, Arabia is likely to find
                        itself on its own as China will be reluctant to back it against another of its allies, Iran.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given this, Arabia should try and mend relations with the US. Aligning with the US would only be
                        possible:

                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            If an alternative buyer to Arabia’s oil can be found (by the US?).
                        </li>
                        <li>If the US decides to re-engage in the region before relations with China deepen to a point
                            where it becomes hard for Arabia to untangle itself from China.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        If Arabia wants to keep its options open, it needs to make sure its relationship with China
                        doesn’t get too deep that even if there was American will to attract Arabia away from China’s
                        orbit, it would be hard for Arabia to break its ties with Beijing. Arabia should leverage the
                        analysis presented here to convince the US to act before it’s too late. As
                        mentioned above,
                        China will need some military presence in the area to ensure oil shipments. This should be the
                        point where Arabia gives the US the choice as there would be no coming back from this.

                    </p>
                    <p>What does it mean for Iran?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Iran has signed a 25 year agreement with China that <a
                            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/world/asia/china-iran-trade-military-deal.html"
                            target="_blank">reportedly
                        </a> involves discounted oil shipments
                        to China in return for infrastructure investment and military and security assistance. US
                        Sanctions on Iran have crippled its economy and so a huge buyer for its oil will shore up
                        Iranian coffers at a time of great need.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no doubt Iran, like any other state in the region, will try to use everything at its
                        disposal, including the alignment with China and the great power clash, to advance its interests
                        in the Middle East. It makes sense from Iran’s point of view to align with China given that the
                        US is not an option. That said, the US saw the demise of many superpowers over the past century
                        or so including Imperial Germany, Nazi Germany, and the Soveit Union, so it might still be the
                        losing side Iran is backing even if it’s the best strategy to pursue at present.

                    </p>
                    <p>What does it mean for Israel?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Israeli officials have proved to be astute strategists over the years. They’ve tried to stay in
                        China’s good books by providing military and technical assistance and establishing strong
                        economic ties with China. Israel even sold American technology to China safe in the knowledge it
                        can always rely on
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy"
                            target="_blank">the powerful Israel lobby in America
                        </a>
                        to soften the blow and convince decision makers to maintain US
                        decades long unconditional support for Israel.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Israel will no doubt continue to try and maintain relations with China in complete disregard to
                        US interests and demands, but when China claims its position as the second superpower in the
                        international system, and the Second Cold War is in full swing, the situation will get to a
                        point when it's not viable anymore for Israel to remain on the fence.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The US has been the main patron of Israel since its inception. There is no doubt Israel, when
                        pushed, will take America’s side, and Israel will continue to be the main US ally in the ME.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As was the case throughout the cold war (and after), Israel will benefit from US support in any
                        potential
                        confrontation with Hizbullah in Lebanon, Syria or even directly Iran.

                    <p>What does it mean for the US & China?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        China needs energy to continue on its path to becoming a superpower that can challenge the US in
                        the international arena. The ME offers the chance to provide China with significant amounts of
                        oil vital to its growth. It
                        makes sense for China to make those deals to secure that energy. However, China faces the almost
                        impossible task of reconciling the difference between its two biggest oil exporters in the ME,
                        Iran and Arabia. The differences between the two countries are huge, and strong religious
                        feelings underpin that rivalry, so when Iran requests support from its partner China that will
                        advance
                        its position in the ME in exchange for oil and continued alignment, Arabia, China’s other big
                        oil exporter, will not be happy and will make sure to let China know.

                        China tries to stick to economic cooperation with its dealings with other countries, but it’s a
                        matter of time before China gets
                        militarily involved simply because no superpower would let one of its main sources of energy
                        unprotected. When this happens China might regret ever getting involved in the ME. This is due
                        to the historic rivalries ravaging the region and which are set to continue to prevail for years
                        to come. China's challenges in the region will largely depend on which side of the fence Saudi
                        Arabia ends up straddling.

                    </p>
                    <p>The US seems to have decided to take the fight to China’s backyard focusing on Asia and leaving
                        the ME behind. This will work in the short term, but the US is bound to come back to the ME when
                        the confrontation with China turns into a fully fledged cold war. The US simply can’t afford to
                        let China control a region like the ME and its resources without doing anything about it. For
                        this
                        reason, it
                        makes sense for the US not to burn all bridges with Arabia. The US needs to monitor Sino-Arabian
                        relations so as to intervene with feasible alternatives when those relations are about to enter
                        a point of no return; mainly a deal with major military and security elements between Arabia and
                        China.
